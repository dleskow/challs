# Challs
CTF challs created by me. May have been used, may also not. Enjoy!

## Structure
Every chall root folder contains the necessary to be solved: the executable, libs and etc. `/Helper` contains compiling info, source code and similars. `/Helper/Launch` contains docker related files.

### About solves
All flags and solves have been removed. If you want to ask me anything (help, solves, relate problems or simple feedback), feel free to contact me (somehow)

### Run Dockers
Just go into `Chall/Helper/Launch` and run ```./run```
